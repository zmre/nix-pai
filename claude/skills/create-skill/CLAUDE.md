# Create Skill - Comprehensive Skill Creation Guide

## 🎯 PURPOSE: EXTENDING THE PAI'S CAPABILITIES THROUGH MODULAR SKILLS

**Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.**

This guide combines:
- Anthropic's official skill methodology
- PAI-specific patterns and conventions
- Best practices from existing skills
- Template-driven quality standards

## 📚 WHAT ARE SKILLS?

### Definition

Skills are contextual packages that:
1. **Extend capabilities**: Add specialized knowledge or workflows
2. **Load progressively**: Metadata → Instructions → Resources
3. **Activate intelligently**: Match user intent to skill descriptions
4. **Work independently**: Self-contained but inherit global context
5. **Follow standards**: Consistent structure across all skills

### Skills vs Slash Commands

**Skills**:
- Contextual knowledge and workflows
- Always available in system prompt
- Triggered by matching user intent
- Can reference slash commands

**Slash Commands**:
- Executable workflows
- Must be explicitly invoked
- Typically orchestrate multiple tools
- Live in `${PAI_DIR}/commands/`

**Relationship**: Skills often invoke slash commands (e.g., research skill calls `/conduct-research`)

## 🏗️ SKILL ARCHITECTURE

### Three-Layer Loading System

**Layer 1: Metadata** (Always Loaded)
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description with activation triggers
---
```
- Appears in `<available_skills>` in system prompt
- Used for intent matching
- Must be concise but complete

**Layer 2: SKILL.md Body** (Loaded When Activated)
- Quick reference instructions
- Core workflows
- Key commands
- Examples
- References to deeper resources

**Layer 3: Supporting Resources** (Loaded As Needed)
- CLAUDE.md (comprehensive context)
- Subdirectories (components, templates, docs)
- Scripts, references, assets

### Directory Structure Patterns

#### Simple Skill Structure
```
${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/fabric-patterns/
└── SKILL.md          # Everything in one file
```

**Use when:**
- Single focused capability
- Minimal context needed
- Quick reference suffices

#### Complex Skill Structure
```
${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/development/
├── SKILL.md                      # Quick reference
├── CLAUDE.md                     # Full methodology
├── primary-stack/                # Reusable components
│   ├── auth-setup.md
│   ├── stripe-billing.md
│   └── business-metrics.md
├── style-guide/                  # UI patterns
│   └── [design resources]
└── [other subdirectories]
```

**Use when:**
- Multi-step workflows
- Extensive methodology
- Multiple sub-components
- Deep context required

## ✍️ WRITING EFFECTIVE SKILLS

### SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does, when to use it, key methods. USE WHEN triggers...
---

# Skill Name

## When to Activate This Skill
- Trigger phrase 1
- Trigger phrase 2
- User intent description

## Core Workflow / Main Instructions
[Primary instructions in imperative form]

## Available Tools / Commands
[Key commands, tools, or methods]

## Examples
[Concrete usage examples]

## Supplementary Resources
For full context: `read ${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/[name]/CLAUDE.md`
For components: `read ${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/[name]/[subdirectory]/`
```

### Description Writing Guidelines

**Critical elements:**
1. **What it does**: Clear capability statement
2. **Key methods/tools**: Mention specific technologies
3. **Activation triggers**: "USE WHEN user says..." phrases
4. **Unique characteristics**: What makes this skill special

**Examples from PAI:**

**Good - research skill:**
```yaml
description: Multi-source comprehensive research using perplexity-researcher,
  claude-researcher, and gemini-researcher agents. Launches up to 10 parallel
  research agents for fast results. USE WHEN user says 'do research', 'research X',
  'find information about', 'investigate', 'analyze trends', 'current events',
  or any research-related request.
```
✅ Clear what it does (multi-source research)
✅ Mentions tools (3 researcher types)
✅ Lists explicit triggers
✅ Explains benefit (parallel, fast)

**Good - chrome-devtools skill:**
```yaml
description: Chrome DevTools MCP for web application debugging, visual testing,
  and browser automation. The ONLY acceptable way to debug web apps - NEVER use
  curl, fetch, or wget. Provides screenshots, console inspection, network monitoring,
  and DOM analysis.
```
✅ States purpose (debugging, testing)
✅ Strong negative trigger (never use curl)
✅ Lists capabilities
✅ Clear domain (web applications)

**Bad example:**
```yaml
description: A skill for development tasks
```
❌ Too vague
❌ No triggers
❌ No tools mentioned
❌ Unclear when to use

### Instruction Writing Standards

**Use imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions):
- ✅ "Create directory structure"
- ✅ "Launch research agents in parallel"
- ✅ "Use Chrome DevTools for debugging"
- ❌ "You should create a directory"
- ❌ "We will launch research agents"

**Be specific and actionable:**
- ✅ "Run `bun dev` to start server"
- ✅ "Execute `/conduct-research` slash command"
- ❌ "Start the application"
- ❌ "Do research"

**Reference, don't duplicate:**
- ✅ "Use contacts from global context"
- ✅ "Follow global security rules"
- ✅ "See CLAUDE.md for full methodology"
- ❌ [Copying entire global context into skill]

## 📋 SKILL CREATION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Planning

**Questions to answer:**
1. What problem does this skill solve?
2. When should it activate? (User phrases)
3. What tools/commands does it use?
4. Is it simple or complex?
5. Does similar skill exist? (Check existing skills)
6. What resources does it need?

**Decision: Simple vs Complex**

Choose SIMPLE if:
- Single focused capability
- < 100 lines of instruction
- No sub-components needed
- Quick reference is sufficient

Choose COMPLEX if:
- Multi-phase workflow
- Requires extensive methodology
- Has multiple components
- Needs deep context documentation

### Phase 2: Structure Creation

**For Simple Skill:**
```bash
mkdir -p ${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/[skill-name]
# Create SKILL.md only
```

**For Complex Skill:**
```bash
mkdir -p ${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/[skill-name]
mkdir -p ${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/[skill-name]/[component-dirs]
# Create SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, and component files
```

### Phase 3: Content Writing

**Step 1: Write description first**
- This drives everything else
- Test by asking: "Would the assistant activate this skill for relevant requests?"

**Step 2: Document activation triggers**
- List explicit user phrases
- Include natural language variations
- Think about how users express this need

**Step 3: Write core instructions**
- Use imperative form
- Be specific and actionable
- Include examples
- Reference deeper resources

**Step 4: Add supporting resources (if complex)**
- CLAUDE.md for methodology
- Component files for reusable pieces
- Templates or examples

### Phase 4: Integration

**Update global context / core skill:**

Edit `${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/CORE/SKILL.md`:
```markdown
<available_skills>
<skill>
<name>your-new-skill</name>
<description>Your description here</description>
<location>user</location>
</skill>
</available_skills>
```

**Verify location:**
- User-created skills: `<location>user</location>`
- System skills: `<location>system</location>`

### Phase 5: Testing

**Test activation:**
1. Use natural language that should trigger skill
2. Verify skill loads correctly
3. Check all file references work
4. Validate against examples

**Test workflow:**
1. Follow instructions step-by-step
2. Verify commands execute correctly
3. Check all tools are available
4. Validate output matches expectations

### Phase 6: Iteration

**Refine based on:**
- Actual usage patterns
- User feedback
- Tool updates
- Methodology improvements

**Skills are living documents** - update as needed!

## 🔗 INTEGRATION WITH PAI INFRASTRUCTURE

### Global Context Inheritance

Skills automatically have access to:
- Contacts (from skills/CORE/SKILL.md)
- Security rules (from skills/CORE/SKILL.md)
- Response format (from skills/CORE/SKILL.md)
- Stack preferences (from skills/CORE/SKILL.md)
- MCP servers (from mcp.json)
- Agents (from agents directory)
- Commands (from commands directory)

**Don't duplicate - reference!**

### Slash Command Integration

Skills often reference slash commands:

```markdown
## How to Execute

**Execute the `/command-name` slash command**, which handles:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
```

**Relationship:**
- Skill = Knowledge + Context
- Command = Executable Workflow
- Skill activates → Command executes

### Agent Integration

Skills can specify agent usage:

```markdown
## Use Trained Agents

For this skill, use:
- **Agent Type**: Purpose
- **Configuration**: `${PAI_DIR}/claude/agents/[name].md`
- **Parallel Execution**: Up to N agents for [work type]
```

### UFC Integration

Skills inherit Universal Output Capture:
- All execution automatically logged
- History searchable via commands
- Learnings captured automatically
- No manual documentation needed

## 🎯 SKILL MAINTENANCE

### When to Update Skills

- Tool versions change (e.g., new MCP capabilities)
- Methodology improves (e.g., better workflows discovered)
- User feedback reveals gaps
- Integration points change
- New components added

### Version Control

Track skill changes in git:
```bash
git add skills/[skill-name]/
git commit -m "Update [skill-name]: [what changed]"
```

### Deprecation

If skill becomes obsolete:
1. Mark as deprecated in description
2. Point to replacement skill
3. Don't delete immediately (grace period)

## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md = quick ref, CLAUDE.md = deep dive
2. **Clear activation**: Description enables intent matching
3. **Executable instructions**: Imperative form, actionable steps
4. **No duplication**: Reference global context, don't copy
5. **Self-contained**: Work independently with clear dependencies
6. **Template-driven**: Use templates for consistency
7. **Test thoroughly**: Validate with real user requests
8. **Iterate constantly**: Skills are living documents
9. **Document clearly**: Future you will thank you
10. **Follow standards**: Consistency across all skills

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Vague Descriptions
❌ "A skill for web development"
✅ "Build applications using spec-kit methodology with TDD..."

### Mistake 2: Duplicating Global Context
❌ Copying contacts list into every skill
✅ "Use contacts from global context"

### Mistake 3: Missing Activation Triggers
❌ No "USE WHEN" phrases
✅ "USE WHEN user says 'do research', 'investigate'..."

### Mistake 4: Imperative Form Violations
❌ "You should create a directory"
✅ "Create directory structure"

### Mistake 5: Over-complicating Simple Skills
❌ Creating CLAUDE.md for 20-line skill
✅ Keep it simple with just SKILL.md

### Mistake 6: Under-documenting Complex Skills
❌ 500-line SKILL.md with no CLAUDE.md
✅ Split into SKILL.md (quick ref) + CLAUDE.md (full)

### Mistake 7: Broken References
❌ Referencing files that don't exist
✅ Verify all paths before committing

### Mistake 8: No Examples
❌ Only abstract instructions
✅ Include concrete usage examples

### Mistake 9: Skipping Testing
❌ Committing without validation
✅ Test with natural language first

## 🎓 LEARNING FROM EXISTING SKILLS

### Study These Examples

**For simple skills:**
- `fabric-patterns` - Clean, focused, complete
- `youtube-extraction` - Single capability, clear workflow
- `email` - Straightforward with important rules

**For complex skills:**
- `development` - Multi-phase methodology, components
- `website` - Full lifecycle management
- `consulting` - Professional service delivery

**For agent skills:**
- `research` - Parallel agent execution
- `development` - Agent collaboration protocol

**Read their code, understand their patterns, apply to your skills.**

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Skill Won't Activate

**Check:**
2. Does description match user's intent?
3. Are activation triggers clear?
4. Test with exact trigger phrases

### Instructions Don't Work

**Check:**
1. Are all referenced files present?
2. Are commands/tools available?
3. Are paths correct?
4. Test step-by-step manually

### Complex Skill Overwhelming

**Solution:**
1. Split into SKILL.md + CLAUDE.md
2. Create component subdirectories
3. Use progressive disclosure
4. Reference rather than include

### Skill Too Generic

**Solution:**
1. Narrow the scope
2. Add specific trigger phrases
3. Define clear boundaries
4. Mention specific tools/methods
