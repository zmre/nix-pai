  Real-time observability dashboard for multi-agent Claude Code sessions.

  Visualize agent interactions, tool usage, and session flows in real-time through a web dashboard. Track multiple agents running in parallel with swim lane visualization, event filtering, and live charts.

  **Key Features:**
  - 🔴 Real-time event streaming via WebSocket
  - 📊 Agent swim lanes showing parallel execution
  - 🔍 Event filtering by agent, session, event type
  - 📈 Live charts for tool usage patterns
  - 💾 Filesystem-based (no database required)

  **Inspired by [@indydevdan](https://github.com/indydevdan)**'s work on multi-agent observability.

  **Our approach:** Filesystem + in-memory streaming vs. indydevdan's SQLite database approach.

# Agent Observability Skill

## Prerequisites

- Bun runtime installed
- Claude Code with hooks configured
- PAI_DIR environment variable set

## Installation

**Quick Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Set environment variable
export PAI_DIR="@paiBasePath@"  # Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc

# 2. Configure hooks (merge into ~/.claude/settings.json)
cat $PAI_DIR/settings.json

# 3. Create directory structure
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pai/history/raw-outputs

# 4. Install dependencies
cd apps/server && bun install
cd ../client && bun install
```

## Usage

### Start the Observability Dashboard

**Terminal 1 - Server:**
```bash
cd $PAI_DIR/claude/skills/agent-observability/apps/server
bun run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Client:**
```bash
cd $PAI_DIR/claude/skills/agent-observability/apps/client
bun run dev
```

**Open browser:** http://localhost:5173

### Using Claude Code

Once the dashboard is running, any Claude Code activity will appear in real-time:

1. Open Claude Code
2. Use any tool (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
3. Launch subagents with Task tool
4. Watch events appear in the dashboard

### Event Types Captured

- **SessionStart** - New Claude Code session begins
- **UserPromptSubmit** - User sends a message
- **PreToolUse** - Before a tool is executed
- **PostToolUse** - After a tool completes
- **Stop** - Main agent task completes
- **SubagentStop** - Subagent task completes
- **SessionEnd** - Session ends

## Features

### Real-Time Visualization

- **Agent Swim Lanes:** See multiple agents (kai, designer, engineer, etc.) running in parallel
- **Event Timeline:** Chronological view of all events
- **Tool Usage Charts:** Visualize which tools are being used most
- **Session Tracking:** Track individual sessions and their lifecycles

### Filtering & Search

- Filter by agent name (kai, designer, engineer, pentester, etc.)
- Filter by event type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)
- Filter by session ID
- Search event payloads

### Data Storage

Events are stored in JSONL (JSON Lines) format:

```
~/.local/share/pai/history/raw-outputs/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_all-events.jsonl
```

Each line is a complete JSON object:
```jsonl
{"source_app":"kai","session_id":"abc123","hook_event_type":"PreToolUse","payload":{...},"timestamp":1234567890,"timestamp_pst":"2025-01-28 14:30:00 PST"}
```

### In-Memory Streaming

- Server keeps last 1000 events in memory
- Low memory footprint
- Fast real-time updates via WebSocket
- No database overhead

```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**PAI_DIR:**
Path to your PAI directory

```bash
export PAI_DIR="@paiBasePath@"
```

### Hooks Configuration

Add to `$PAI_DIR/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/agent-observability/hooks/capture-all-events.ts --event-type PreToolUse"
      }]
    }],
    // ... other hooks
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### No events appearing

1. Check PAI_DIR is set: `echo $PAI_DIR`
2. Verify directory exists: `ls ~/.local/state/pai/history/raw-outputs/`
3. Check hook is executable: `ls -l hooks/capture-all-events.ts`
4. Look for today's events file: `ls ~/.local/state/pai/history/raw-outputs/$(date +%Y-%m)/`

### Server won't start

1. Check Bun is installed: `bun --version`
2. Verify dependencies: `cd apps/server && bun install`
3. Check port 3001 isn't in use: `lsof -i :3001`

### Client won't connect

1. Ensure server is running first
2. Check WebSocket connection in browser console
3. Verify no firewall blocking localhost:3001

## Credits

**Inspired by [@indydevdan](https://github.com/indydevdan)**'s pioneering work on multi-agent observability for Claude Code.

**Our implementation differs** by using filesystem-based event capture and in-memory streaming instead of SQLite database persistence. Both approaches have their merits! Check out indydevdan's work for a database-backed solution with full historical persistence.

## Development

### Running in Development

```bash
# Server (hot reload)
cd apps/server
bun --watch src/index.ts

# Client (Vite dev server)
cd apps/client
bun run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Client build
cd apps/client
bun run build
bun run preview
```

### Adding New Event Types

1. Update `capture-all-events.ts` hook if needed
2. Add hook configuration to `settings.json`
3. Client will automatically display new event types
