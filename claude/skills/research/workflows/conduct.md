# 🔬 COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH WORKFLOW FOR @assistantName@

**YOU (@assistantName@) are reading this because a research request was detected by the load-context hook.**

This command provides instructions for YOU to orchestrate comprehensive multi-source research by directly invoking researcher commands (NOT spawning new Claude Code sessions).

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION

When a user asks for research, YOU must deliver **FAST RESULTS** through massive parallelization:

**THREE RESEARCH MODES:**

1. **Quick Research: 3 agents (1 of each type)**
   - 1 perplexity-researcher + 1 claude-researcher + 1 gemini-researcher
   - Use when user says "quick research" or simple queries
   - Fastest mode: ~15-20 seconds

2. **Standard Research: 9 agents (3 of each type)**
   - 3 perplexity-researcher + 3 claude-researcher + 3 gemini-researcher
   - Default mode for most research requests
   - Balanced coverage: ~30 seconds

3. **Extensive Research: 24 agents (8 of each type)**
   - 8 perplexity-researcher + 8 claude-researcher + 8 gemini-researcher
   - Use when user says "extensive research"
   - Exhaustive coverage: ~45-60 seconds

**Workflow for all modes:**
1. Decompose question into focused sub-questions (appropriate to mode)
2. Launch all agents in parallel (SINGLE message with multiple Task calls)
3. Each agent does ONE query + ONE follow-up max
4. Collect results as they complete
5. Synthesize findings into comprehensive report
6. Report back using mandatory response format

**Speed Strategy:**
- Each agent handles a specific angle/sub-question
- Parallel execution = results in under 1 minute
- Follow-up queries only when critical information is missing

## 🔥 EXTENSIVE RESEARCH MODE (24 AGENTS)

**ACTIVATION:** User says "extensive research" or "do extensive research on X"

**WORKFLOW:**

### Step 0: Activate Creative Query Generation

**Use be-creative skill to generate 24 diverse research angles:**

```
<instructions>
ULTRATHINK + VERBALIZED SAMPLING MODE:

STEP 1 - ULTRATHINK:
Think deeply and extensively about this research topic:
- Explore multiple unusual perspectives and domains
- Question all assumptions about what's relevant
- Make unexpected connections across different fields
- Consider edge cases, controversies, and emerging trends
- Think about historical context, future implications, and cross-disciplinary angles
- What questions would experts from different fields ask?

STEP 2 - GENERATE 24 DIVERSE RESEARCH QUERIES:
Based on your deep thinking, generate 24 unique research angles/sub-questions.
Each should be distinct, creative, and explore a different facet of the topic.
Mix different types: technical, historical, practical, controversial, emerging, comparative, etc.

Organize them into 3 groups of 8:
- Group 1 (Perplexity): [8 queries optimized for broad web search]
- Group 2 (Claude): [8 queries optimized for academic/detailed analysis]
- Group 3 (Gemini): [8 queries optimized for multi-perspective synthesis]
</instructions>

[User's research topic]
```

### Step 1: Launch 24 Research Agents in Parallel

**CRITICAL: Use a SINGLE message with 24 Task tool calls**

```typescript
// Launch 8 perplexity-researcher agents
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 1", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 2", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 3", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 4", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 5", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 6", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 7", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 8", prompt: "..." })

// Launch 8 claude-researcher agents
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 9", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 10", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 11", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 12", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 13", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 14", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 15", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 16", prompt: "..." })

// Launch 8 gemini-researcher agents
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 17", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 18", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 19", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 20", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 21", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 22", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 23", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 24", prompt: "..." })
```

**Each agent prompt should:**
- Include the specific creative query angle
- **Instruct: "Do 1-2 focused searches and return findings. YOU HAVE UP TO 3 MINUTES - return results as soon as you have useful findings."**
- Keep it concise but thorough
- Agents should return as soon as they have substantive findings (don't artificially wait)

### Step 2: Wait for Agents to Complete (UP TO 10 MINUTES FOR EXTENSIVE)

**CRITICAL TIMEOUT RULE: After 10 minutes from launch, proceed with synthesis using only the agents that have returned results.**

- Each agent has up to 10 minutes to complete their research (extensive mode)
- Agents should return as soon as they have substantive findings
- **HARD TIMEOUT: 10 minutes** - After 10 minutes from launch, DO NOT wait longer
- Proceed with synthesis using whatever results have been returned
- Note which agents didn't respond in your final report
- **TIMELY RESULTS > PERFECT COMPLETENESS**

### Step 3: Synthesize Extensive Research Results

**Enhanced synthesis requirements for extensive research:**
- Identify themes across all 24 research angles
- Cross-validate findings from multiple agents and perspectives
- Highlight unique insights from each agent type
- Map coverage across different domains/aspects
- Identify gaps or conflicting information
- Calculate comprehensive metrics (24 agents, ~48+ queries, 3 services)

**Report structure:**
```markdown
## Executive Summary
[1-2 paragraph overview of comprehensive findings]

## Key Findings by Domain

- Total Output: ~[X] words
- Confidence Level: [High/Medium] ([%])
```

## 🚀 QUICK RESEARCH WORKFLOW (3 AGENTS - 1 OF EACH TYPE)

**ACTIVATION:** User says "quick research" or simple/straightforward queries

**Workflow:**

### Step 1: Identify 3 Core Angles

Break the question into 3 focused sub-questions - one optimized for each agent type:
- **Angle 1 (Perplexity):** Current/web-based information
- **Angle 2 (Claude):** Detailed/analytical perspective
- **Angle 3 (Gemini):** Multi-perspective synthesis

### Step 2: Launch 3 Agents in Parallel

```typescript
// SINGLE message with 3 Task calls
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Current info", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Deep analysis", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Multi-perspective", prompt: "..." })
```

### Step 3: Quick Synthesis (2 MINUTE TIMEOUT)

**CRITICAL TIMEOUT RULE: After 2 minutes from launch, proceed with synthesis using only the agents that have returned results.**

- Each agent has up to 2 minutes (quick mode)
- **HARD TIMEOUT: 2 minutes from launch** - Do NOT wait longer
- Synthesize perspectives that returned into cohesive answer
- Note any non-responsive agents in report
- Report with standard format

## 📋 STANDARD RESEARCH WORKFLOW (9 AGENTS - 3 OF EACH TYPE)

**ACTIVATION:** Default mode for most research requests

**Workflow:**

### Step 1: Decompose Question & Launch 9 Agents

**Step 1a: Break Down the Research Question**

Decompose the user's question into 9 specific sub-questions:
- 3 questions optimized for Perplexity (web/current)
- 3 questions optimized for Claude (academic/detailed)
- 3 questions optimized for Gemini (multi-perspective)

Each question should cover:
- Different angles of the topic
- Specific aspects to investigate
- Related areas that provide context
- Potential edge cases or controversies

**Step 1b: Launch 9 Research Agents in Parallel**

Use the **Task tool** - SINGLE message with 9 Task calls:

```typescript
// Launch 3 perplexity-researcher agents
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 1", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 2", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "perplexity-researcher", description: "Query 3", prompt: "..." })

// Launch 3 claude-researcher agents
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 4", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 5", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "claude-researcher", description: "Query 6", prompt: "..." })

// Launch 3 gemini-researcher agents
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 7", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 8", prompt: "..." })
Task({ subagent_type: "gemini-researcher", description: "Query 9", prompt: "..." })
```

**Available Research Agents:**
- **perplexity-researcher**: Fast Perplexity API searches
- **claude-researcher**: Claude WebSearch with intelligent query decomposition
- **gemini-researcher**: Google Gemini multi-perspective research

**CRITICAL RULES FOR SPEED:**
1. ✅ **Launch ALL 9 agents in ONE message** (parallel execution)
2. ✅ **Each agent gets ONE specific sub-question** (focused research)
3. ✅ **3 agents per type** (balanced coverage)
4. ✅ **Each agent does 1 query + 1 follow-up max** (quick cycles)
5. ✅ **Results return in ~30 seconds** (parallel processing)
6. ❌ **DON'T launch sequentially** (kills speed benefit)
7. ❌ **DON'T give broad questions** (forces multiple iterations)

### Step 2: Collect Results (UP TO 3 MINUTES FOR STANDARD)

**CRITICAL TIMEOUT RULE: After 3 minutes from launch, proceed with synthesis using only the agents that have returned results.**

- Each agent has up to 3 minutes to complete their research (standard mode)
- **Typical time:** Most agents return in 30-120 seconds
- **HARD TIMEOUT: 3 minutes** - After 3 minutes from launch, DO NOT wait longer
- Proceed with synthesis using whatever results have been returned
- Note which agents didn't respond in your final report
- **TIMELY RESULTS > PERFECT COMPLETENESS**

Each agent returns:
- Focused findings from their specific sub-question
- Source citations
- Confidence indicators
- Quick insights

### Step 3: Synthesize Results

Create a comprehensive report that:

**A. Identifies Confidence Levels:**
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE**: Findings corroborated by multiple sources
- **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE**: Found by one source, seems reliable
- **LOW CONFIDENCE**: Single source, needs verification

**B. Structures Information:**
```markdown
