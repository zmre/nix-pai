name: research
description: Multi-source comprehensive research using claude-researcher and gemini-researcher agents. Three modes - Quick (3 agents), Standard (9 agents), Extensive (24 agents with be-creative skill). USE WHEN user says 'do research', 'quick research', 'extensive research', 'find information about', 'investigate', 'analyze trends', 'current events', or any research-related request.

# Research Skill

## 🎯 Load Full PAI Context

**Before starting any task with this skill, load complete PAI context:**

`read ${PAI_DIR}/claude/skills/CORE/SKILL.md`

This provides access to:
- Complete contact list and team members
- Stack preferences (rust>TypeScript, TypeScript>Python, bun>npm, uv>pip)
- Security rules and repository safety protocols
- Response format requirements (structured emoji format)
- Personal preferences and operating instructions

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when the user requests research or information gathering:
- "Do research on X"
- "Research this topic"
- "Find information about X"
- "Investigate this subject"
- "Analyze trends in X"
- "Current events research"
- Any comprehensive information gathering request

**THREE RESEARCH MODES:**

**QUICK RESEARCH MODE:**
- User says "quick research" → Launch 3 agents (1 of each type)
- **Timeout: 2 minutes** | Main assistant waits 2 minutes then synthesizes
- Best for: Simple queries, straightforward questions

**STANDARD RESEARCH MODE (Default):**
- Default for most research requests → Launch 9 agents (3 of each type)
- **Timeout: 3 minutes** | Main assistant waits 3 minutes then synthesizes
- Best for: Most research needs, comprehensive coverage

**EXTENSIVE RESEARCH MODE:**
- User says "extensive research" → Launch 24 agents (8 of each type)
- Use be-creative skill with UltraThink for maximum query diversity
- Generate 24 unique, creative research angles
- **Timeout: 10 minutes** | Main assistant waits 10 minutes then synthesizes
- Best for: Deep-dive research, multi-domain analysis, comprehensive reports

**⏱️ CRITICAL TIMEOUT RULES:**
- **Quick (3 agents): 2 minute timeout**
- **Standard (9 agents): 3 minute timeout**
- **Extensive (24 agents): 10 minute timeout**
- After timeout, main assistant STOPS WAITING and synthesizes with whatever results are available
- Proceed with partial results - don't wait indefinitely for stragglers

## How to Execute

**Execute the `/conduct-research` slash command**, which handles the complete workflow:

1. Decomposing research questions into 3-24 sub-questions
2. Launching up to 24 parallel research agents (claude, gemini)
3. Collecting results in 15-60 seconds (**HARD TIMEOUT: 3 minutes max**)
4. Synthesizing findings with confidence levels (even with partial results)
5. Formatting comprehensive report with source attribution

## Available Research Agents

- **claude-researcher**: Claude WebSearch with intelligent query decomposition (academic/detailed)
- **gemini-researcher**: Google Gemini multi-perspective research (synthesis)

## Speed Benefits

- ❌ **Old approach**: Sequential searches → 5-10 minutes
- ✅ **Quick mode**: 3 parallel agents → **2 minute timeout**
- ✅ **Standard mode**: 9 parallel agents → **3 minute timeout**
- ✅ **Extensive mode**: 24 parallel agents → **10 minute timeout**

**⏱️ CRITICAL: After timeout, proceed with whatever results are available. DO NOT wait indefinitely for slow agents.**

## 📁 Scratchpad → History Pattern

**Working Directory (Scratchpad):** `~/.local/share/pai/scratchpad/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_research-[topic]/`

**Process:**

1. **Scratchpad (Working Files - Temporary):**
   - Create timestamped directory for each research project
   - Store raw research outputs from all agents
   - Keep intermediate synthesis notes
   - Save query decomposition and analysis
   - Draft reports and iterations

2. **History (Permanent Archive):**
   - Move to `~/.local/share/pai/history/research/YYYY-MM-DD_[topic]/` when complete
   - Include: `README.md`, final research report, key data files
   - Archive for future reference and reuse

3. **Verification (MANDATORY):**
   - Check if hooks captured output to history automatically
   - If hooks failed, manually save to history
   - Confirm all files present in history directory

**File Structure Example:**

**Scratchpad (temporary workspace):**
```
~/.local/share/pai/scratchpad/2025-10-26-143022_research-agi-frameworks/
├── raw-outputs/
│   ├── claude-001.md
│   └── gemini-001.md
├── synthesis-notes.md
├── query-decomposition.md
└── draft-report.md
```

**History (permanent archive):**
```
~/.local/share/pai/history/research/2025-10-26_agi-frameworks/
├── README.md (research documentation)
├── research-report.md (final comprehensive report)
├── key-findings.md (executive summary)
└── metadata.json (sources, agents used, timestamps)
```
