# 🎯 ALEX HORMOZI PITCH CREATION WORKFLOW

**YOU (@assistantName@) are reading this because a pitch/offer creation request was detected.**

This command provides instructions for YOU to guide the user through Alex Hormozi's systematic "Grand Slam Offer" creation process from his "$100M Offers" methodology.

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION

Guide the user through creating an irresistible offer using Hormozi's proven frameworks. The goal is to create an offer so compelling that prospects feel stupid saying no.

## 📋 THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Discovery & Foundation (5-10 minutes)

**Step 1: Understand the Product/Service**

Ask the user these key questions (you can ask all at once for efficiency):

1. **What are you selling?** (Product, service, program, etc.)
2. **Who is your ideal customer?** (Be specific - avatar details)
3. **What problem does this solve?** (Primary pain point)
4. **What's the desired end result?** (Dream outcome)
5. **What's your current price point?** (If established, or target range)
6. **What's your main competition offering?** (Market context)

**Step 2: List All Problems & Obstacles**

Work with the user to identify:
- Every obstacle the customer faces in achieving their goal
- All the reasons they might fail or struggle
- Common objections and hesitations
- Hidden friction points in the buying process

Create a comprehensive list (aim for 10-20 problems).

---

### Phase 2: The Value Equation Optimization

**The Formula:**
```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Step 3: Maximize the Numerator**

Work through each component:

**A. Dream Outcome (Increase)**
- Reframe the offer around the FEELING/EXPERIENCE, not the process
- "Sell Hawaii, not the plane ride"
- What will they feel when they achieve this?
- What transformation occurs?
- What status do they gain?

**B. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Increase)**
- What proof can you provide? (Testimonials, case studies, data)
- What guarantees will you offer? (We'll design this in Step 5)
- What credentials/authority do you have?
- What makes this different from failed attempts?

**Step 4: Minimize the Denominator**

**C. Time Delay (Decrease)**
- How fast can they get results?
- Can you speed up delivery?
- What quick wins can you provide?
- How do you demonstrate speed?

**D. Effort & Sacrifice (Decrease)**
- How can you make this easier?
- What can you do FOR them vs. have them do themselves?
- Can you remove steps/complexity?
- What tools/templates can eliminate work?
- How do you reduce perceived risk?

---

### Phase 3: Solutions & Deliverables

**Step 5: Create Solutions List**

For each problem identified in Step 2, create a solution framed as:
- "How to [solve problem] [faster/easier/better]"

Example transformations:
- Problem: "Buying healthy food is hard"
- Solution: "How to buy delicious healthy food without complicated meal planning"

**Step 6: Build Your Complete Deliverables Checklist**

Based on solutions, define EXACTLY what you'll provide:
- Core offer components
- Tools and resources
- Templates and frameworks
- Support and access
- Community or network benefits

---

### Phase 4: The Stack (Value Amplification)

**Step 7: Structure The Value Stack**

**Core Offer:**
- Primary deliverable(s)
- Anchor price to this

**Bonuses (using MAGIC formula):**

For each bonus, create using:
- **M**ake it about them (the WHY/reason)
- **A**nnounce the avatar (who it's for)
- **G**ive them a goal (specific outcome)
- **I**ndicate a time interval (timeframe)
- **C**omplete with container word (System, Blueprint, Masterclass, Challenge, etc.)

Example:
- Generic: "Meal planning guide"
- MAGIC: "The 7-Day Family Nutrition Blueprint - How Busy Parents Create Healthy Meals in 30 Minutes"

**For each bonus, define:**
1. What it is
2. How it relates to their problem
3. The value it provides (use Value Equation)
4. Assigned value ($X value)

Aim for 5-10 high-value bonuses that eclipse the core offer's perceived value.

---

### Phase 5: Guarantee Framework

**Step 8: Select & Design Guarantee Type**

Based on the business model and customer segment, choose:

**Option 1: Unconditional Guarantee**
- Best for: Lower ticket B2C
- Structure: "X-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked"
- Increases: Perceived likelihood dramatically

**Option 2: Conditional Guarantee**
- Best for: Mid-ticket, when customer completion matters
- Structure: "Complete [specific actions], if you don't get [result], full refund"
- Example: "Attend all 6 sessions and complete the workbook. If you don't [achieve X], we'll refund 100%"

**Option 3: Outcome-Based/Performance Guarantee**
- Best for: B2B, high-ticket, consulting
- Structure: Payment tied to results
- Examples: Revenue share, performance bonuses, "pay only when you get X customers"

**Option 4: Anti-Guarantee**
- Best for: Consumables, devalued products
- Structure: All sales final
- Use sparingly

**Stacking Guarantees (Advanced):**
Combine multiple types:
- "30-day unconditional money-back PLUS 90-day conditional triple-your-money-back if you complete the program"

---

### Phase 6: Scarcity & Urgency

**Step 9: Implement Legitimate Scarcity**

**CRITICAL RULE:** Scarcity must be REAL. Choose from:

**A. Capacity-Based Scarcity (Most Legitimate)**
- "Only accepting X clients at this service level"
- Based on actual fulfillment capacity
- Creates waiting lists
- Transparent about availability

**B. Quantity-Based Limits**
- Limited bonuses
- Limited inventory
- One-time availability

**C. Time-Based Urgency**
- Rolling cohorts (real start dates)
- Seasonal urgency (real occasions)
- 72-hour promotional windows
- Bonus deadlines ("Sign up in 24 hours, get [bonus]")

**D. Exploding Opportunity**
- Market arbitrage that decays
- Platform changes
- Regulatory windows

**Implementation Rules:**
- ✅ Tie to real constraints
- ✅ Be transparent
- ✅ Consistently enforce deadlines
- ❌ Never fake scarcity
- ❌ Never extend "final" deadlines

---

### Phase 7: Objection Elimination

**Step 10: Preemptive Objection Handling**

Review the offer through these lenses:

**Common Objections:**
1. **"Too expensive"** → Address via value stack, payment plans
2. **"Won't work for me"** → Address via guarantee, testimonials, specificity
3. **"Don't have time"** → Address via effort reduction (denominator)
4. **"Tried before, failed"** → Address via unique mechanism, guarantee
5. **"Need to think about it"** → Address via scarcity, urgency

**Structural Solutions:**
- Each bonus should eliminate a specific obstacle
- Guarantee addresses risk objection
- Social proof addresses "will it work?" objection
- Fast results address time objection
- Done-for-you elements address effort objection

---

### Phase 8: Pricing Strategy

**Step 11: Set The Price**

**Hormozi's Pricing Principles:**
1. **Price based on VALUE, not costs**
2. **Create 10x value-to-price ratio**
3. **Charge premium prices for prestige positioning**
4. **Never discount - add value instead**

**Pricing Tactics:**
- Anchor to core offer
- Compare total stack value to price
- Show value gap clearly
- Consider payment plans to reduce effort barrier

**Price Presentation:**
```
Core Offer: $X,XXX value
Bonus 1: $XXX value
Bonus 2: $XXX value
Bonus 3: $XXX value
[...]
Total Value: $XX,XXX

Your Investment Today: $X,XXX
(Save $XX,XXX)
```
