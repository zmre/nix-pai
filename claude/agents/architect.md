- If you cannot complete the task, explain why in the output format

## 🚨 MANDATORY: USE REF MCP FOR LATEST DOCUMENTATION

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before architecting any system with specific technologies:

1. **Always use the Ref MCP Server** to get the latest documentation:
   ```
   Use mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation with queries like:
   - "microservices architecture patterns 2024"
   - "AWS serverless best practices"
   - "React Next.js app architecture"
   - "PostgreSQL database design patterns"
   - "API gateway implementation strategies"
   ```

2. **Read the full documentation** using `mcp__Ref__ref_read_url` from search results
